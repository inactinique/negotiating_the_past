<h1>negotiating the past?</h1>
<p>historical representations / artificial intelligence / collective
memory</p>
<!-- <small>prompt: Draw an image representing what is collective memory</small> -->
<aside class="notes">
<p>This presentation explores the intersection of historical
representations, artificial intelligence, and collective memory.</p>
<p>Negotiating the past? In a way, we – as a collective body, a society
– are negotiating the past in different spaces: committees that define
which historical knowledge students should learn, for instance. In more
dramatic circumstances, Truth and Reconciliation commissions, like in
South Africa, are also some sort of spaces to negotiate the past, or, in
this precise case, to negotiate which reparation should be defined from
social groups that suffered from conflicting past. But to define those
reparations, there should first be an agreement, or at least some sort
of non opposition to the way the commission is seeing the past.
Concerning an event that is more linked to my very old doctoral
research, the international military trial in Nurenberg was a space of
negotation of the past – with the very caricatural position on the Katyn
massacre for instance.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to today’s subject. I’ll try to examine how users
“negotiate” with AI systems to express their conceptions of the past,
how these interactions can reveal tensions between user expectations and
AI-embedded historical patterns, and how to instert this into memory
studies.</p>
<p>Just one word on memory studies: historians are not that many to be
active in the field of memory studies, though historians are a lot
speaking about collective or cultural memory. To my opinion, it may have
been useful – because memory studies also fostered some sort of
redefinition of what is memory – but historians should be aware that
today, they should also go into memory studies.</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ll try first to show how LLMs encode historical perspectives,
trying to set up a theoretical framework.</li>
<li>I’ll then show how I am using myself AI and LLMs to get prompts
containing reference(s) to the past, to set up a corpus of prompts to
analyse, and how I do analyse them.</li>
<li>I’ll then comment the analyses before concluding on chatbots /
diffusion systems as new spaces for negotiation on the diverse ways we
collectively see the past.</li>

<h2>LLMs and Embedded Historical Patterns</h2>
<p>LLMs here are used as examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>LLMs as Statistical Pattern Recognizers</li>
<li>Training Data as Historical Record</li>
<li>Historical Biases in Language Models</li>
<li>“Stochastic Parrots” and Historical Truth</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>LLMs rely on transformer architectures that predict tokens based on
previous context. Their “knowledge” of history comes from statistical
patterns in training data, not genuine understanding. This creates an
interesting dynamic when users prompt these systems about historical
topics - the system’s responses reveal embedded historical narratives
from their training data.</p>

<section id="historical-knowledge-in-vector-space" class="slide level2">
<h2>Historical Knowledge in Vector Space</h2>
<ul>
<li>Word embeddings capture semantic relationships</li>
<li>Historical concepts represented as vectors</li>
<li>Temporal relationships encoded in semantic proximity</li>
<li>Cultural associations embedded in language patterns</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Within the vector space of LLMs, historical concepts are encoded as
points in multidimensional space. The relationships between historical
events, figures, and concepts are captured in the distances and
directions between these vectors. These semantic relationships reflect
collective memory patterns from the training corpus.</p>
<p>Latent space: historical concepts are then ‘compressed’ into a latent
space</p>

<h2>Collective Memory and LLMs</h2>
<ul>
<li>LLMs as ‘repositories’ of digitized collective memory</li>
<li>Training data selection as memory politics</li>
<li>The “averaged” nature of AI-generated historical narratives</li>
<li>Absence of contested memory in statistical consensus</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>From a memory studies perspective, LLMs function as repositories of
digitized collective memory. The selection of training data constitutes
a form of memory politics, determining which historical perspectives are
included or excluded. The statistical nature of these models produces
“averaged” historical narratives that often elide contestation and
complexity.</p>
<p>See the special issue we co-edited with Sarah Gensburger, out last
december. Several articles insist on the “average” nature of LLMs but
also the capitalistic nature of chatbots and generative AI systems: they
must give the most ‘popular’ or ‘pleasant’ version of an answer to a
prompt, including the past.</p>

<h1>Part II: Methodological Approach</h1>

</section>
<section id="the-challenge-of-historical-prompt-identification"
class="slide level2">
<h2>The Challenge of Historical Prompt Identification</h2>
<ul>
<li>Beyond simple keyword approaches</li>
<li>Historical references: explicit vs. implicit</li>
<li>Temporality in language</li>
<li>Building a robust identification strategy</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Identifying prompts that reference history requires more
sophisticated approaches than simple keyword matching. Historical
references can be explicit (“Napoleon Bonaparte”) or implicit (“the
Emperor’s exile”), and may involve complex temporal markers. Our
methodology must capture this complexity.</p>
</aside>
</section>
<section id="see-code" class="slide level2">
<h2>see code</h2>
<ul>
<li>usign DistillBERT (simpler) to create word embeddings based on
“seeds” (large concepts around the historical past)</li>
<li>thanks to word embeddings, we can then select prompts that are
linked to “history”.</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Our technical approach involves transforming prompts into vector
representations to enable semantic analysis. By using text embedding
techniques, we can identify prompts with historical references beyond
simple keyword matching. This allows us to build a dataset that captures
the rich variety of ways people reference the past.</p>
</aside>
<aside class="notes">
<p>To identify prompts with historical references, we use both lexical
and semantic approaches. Starting with seed historical terms, we expand
to semantically similar concepts using word embeddings. We can then
filter prompts either through string matching or by measuring the
semantic similarity between prompts and historical concepts using cosine
similarity of their vector representations.</p>
</aside>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Once we’ve identified historically-related prompts, we use clustering
techniques to discover common themes and patterns. By applying
dimensionality reduction with UMAP and clustering with DBSCAN, we can
identify groups of prompts that reference similar historical concepts,
periods, or events. This allows us to map the landscape of historical
imagination as expressed through user prompts.</p>

<h1>Part III: Results Analysis</h1>

</section>
<section id="key-findings-historical-references-in-prompts"
class="slide level2">
<h2>Key Findings: Historical References in Prompts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Temporal distribution of historical references</li>
<li>Common historical personas, events, and eras</li>
<li>Stylistic patterns in historical prompts</li>
<li>Historical accuracy vs. creative liberty</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Our analysis reveals several patterns in how users reference history
in their prompts. We observe a distribution across different historical
periods, with certain eras receiving more attention than others. Popular
historical figures and events appear frequently, often with creative
embellishments that reveal more about contemporary imagination than
historical fact.</p>

<section id="conflicting-historical-narratives" class="slide level2">
<h2>Conflicting Historical Narratives</h2>
<p>knitr::include_graphics(“images/narrative-conflicts.png”)</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>We observe interesting conflicts between user expectations and
AI-generated content, particularly around contested historical
narratives. Users often prompt for versions of history that align with
their preconceptions, while AI systems may present different
perspectives based on their training data. These negotiations reveal the
tension between personal historical imagination and collective
historical narratives.</p>

<section id="user-negotiation-patterns" class="slide level2">
<h2>User Negotiation Patterns</h2>
<ul>
<li>Prompt refinement strategies</li>
<li>Adjective use to guide historical tone</li>
<li>Specificity vs. generality in historical requests</li>
<li>“Historical” as stylistic marker</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Users employ various strategies to negotiate with AI systems when
requesting historical content. They refine prompts through iteration,
use specific adjectives to guide the tone of historical representation,
and vary between highly specific historical requests and general period
references. Many users also use “historical” as a stylistic marker
rather than a request for historical accuracy.</p>

<h2>Case Study: European Historical References</h2>
<p>knitr::include_graphics(“images/europe-history-network.png”)</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Building on our previous analysis of prompts containing “European
Union,” we observe how users connect contemporary European politics with
various historical periods and concepts. References to empires, wars,
and political movements reveal how users conceptualize European history
in relation to current events. These connections offer insight into how
collective memory shapes understanding of present political
entities.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>GenAI platforms as a New Space for Historical Negotiation</p>
<ul>
<li>Comparing with traditional sites of historical consensus</li>
<li>Public vs. private negotiation of historical understanding</li>
<li>The role of algorithms in mediating historical perspectives</li>
<li>Implications for collective memory formation</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>AI systems represent a new space for the negotiation of historical
understanding, distinct from traditional sites like educational
curricula, museums, or truth commissions. Unlike these institutional
spaces, AI interactions are often private, individualized, and
algorithmically mediated. This raises important questions about how
collective memory will form in an era where historical understanding is
increasingly negotiated through technological interfaces.</p>
</aside>
</section>
<section id="future-research-directions" class="slide level2">
<h2>Future Research Directions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Longitudinal analysis of historical prompts</li>
<li>Cross-cultural comparisons of historical references</li>
<li>Educational applications of prompt analysis</li>
<li>Ethical considerations for AI-mediated historical understanding</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>This research opens several promising directions for future work.
Longitudinal studies could track how historical references in prompts
evolve over time in response to current events. Cross-cultural analyses
might reveal different patterns of historical reference across languages
and regions. Educational applications could help develop more
historically-informed AI systems. Finally, ethical considerations around
AI’s role in mediating historical understanding require careful
attention.</p>
