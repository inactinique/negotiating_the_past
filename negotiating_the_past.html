<p>historical representations / artificial intelligence / collective
memory</p>
<!-- <small>prompt: Draw an image representing what is collective memory</small> -->
<aside class="notes">
<p>This talk will explore the intersection of historical
representations, artificial intelligence, and collective memory.</p>
<p>Negotiating the past? In a way, we – as a collective body, a society
– are “negotiating” the past in different spaces: committees that define
which historical knowledge students should learn, for instance. In more
dramatic circumstances, Truth and Reconciliation commissions, like in
South Africa, are also some sort of spaces to negotiate the past, or, in
this precise case, to negotiate which reparation should be defined from
social groups that suffered from conflicting past. But to define those
reparations, there should first be an agreement, or at least some sort
of non opposition to the way the commission is seeing the past.
Concerning an event that is more linked to my very old doctoral
research, the international military trial in Nurenberg was a space of
negotation of the past – with the very caricatural position on the Katyn
massacre for instance.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to today’s subject. I’ll try to examine how users
“negotiate” with AI systems to express their conceptions of the past,
how these interactions can reveal tensions between user expectations and
AI-embedded historical patterns, and how to instert this into memory
studies.</p>
<p>Just one word on memory studies: historians are not that many to be
active in the field of memory studies, though historians are a lot
speaking about collective or cultural memory. To my opinion, it may have
been useful – because memory studies also fostered some sort of
redefinition of what is memory – but historians should be aware that
today, they should also go into memory studies.</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ll try first to show how LLMs encode historical perspectives,
trying to set up a theoretical framework.</li>
<li>I’ll then show how I am using myself AI and LLMs to get prompts
containing reference(s) to the past, to set up a corpus of prompts to
analyse, and how I do analyse them.</li>
<li>I’ll then comment the analyses before concluding on chatbots /
diffusion systems as new spaces for negotiation on the diverse ways we
collectively see the past.</li>

<h2 data-background-color="#000000">chatbots as medium of memory</h2>
<p><img data-src="img/invite.gif" /></p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>I define here ‘chatbots’ as generative AI platform for wide
audiences, made of an interface that encourages users to enter a prompt,
in ordre to generate text, images, videos, and are more and more
multimodal – inputs can be texts or images, as well as outputs. So we
consider here chatbots that are based on diffusion systems or large
language models.</p>
<p>We also consider chatbots, and not directly their underlying engines
(large language models, or diffusion systems), because chatbots have
additional layer of alignments and fine tuning.</p>
<p>For instance, DeepSeek – the chatbot – is well known to refuse to
answer a question on the Tiananmen massacre. But if you use DeepSeek R1
(I’ve testes the 7b parameters one), it does not, though it clearly
indicates in its reasoning that it should be respecting the chinese law
and sensibility on the subject.</p>
<p>This Tienanmen example brings us back to memory: on those additional
layers of allignment and fine tuning that are made to allow wide
audiences to use easily chatbots, there are additional views on the past
that are modified or embedded.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to chatbots as medium of memory.</p>
<ul>
<li>chatbots are based on models that are storing information. Models
are sets of parameters deduced from a training phase, or patterns based
on training datasets, that we don’t always know precisely, but contain
large expurged snapshots of the web, wikidpedia, probably books
datasets, etc. In this sense they can be seen as storage of information,
including information on the historical past,</li>
<li>chatbots allow a form of circulation of information: that’s why they
are here, or at least why you pay to use them. Nevertheless, their
stochastic ways to restitute information, that does not include any
sense of truth, of facts, that can lead to hallucinations, should be
carefully considered.</li>
<li>chatbots are also triggers of collective memory. That’s their
interface, based on, often, a single box where users can type questions.
Studying the past, in a professional way or a more amateur one, is all
about asking questions and trying to find ways – sources and their
analysis – to answer them. prompts are huge incentives / triggers to
query the past, even if they are not only about that, of course.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, if we consider chatbots as medium of memory, we should also try
understanding how they embed views on the past.</p>

<h2 data-background-color="#000000">chatbots and historical
patterns</h2>
<p><img data-src="img/fractal.gif" /></p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>We’ll take the example of text generation through LLMs. LLMs are
statistical pattern recognizers. They can use patterns to “generate the
next word” thanks to their training phase, based on trianing data. As I
said earlier, this training data is not well known, but we should
consider it as historians: it is an archive, it is made of historical
records. But as all historical records, they contain specific views of
the past – I could speak of ‘biases’, but I think this word is really
not pertinent. And, the way the training phase is embedding those views
of the past into the model is not at all the way we are dealing with
historical records as historians. There’s no critical appraisal of those
historical records. What matters are patterns, probabilities.</p>
<p>Hence the famouse article of Bender et al. on stochastic parrots.
Applying probabilities, patterns to the historical past is not at all
the way we are working to try to reconstitute the past.</p>

<h2 data-background-color="#000000">aligning the past</h2>
<p><img data-src="img/leopold.png" /></p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>To this stochastic ways to generate texts / images about the past, we
should also look at the alignment, feedback (with or without humans in
the loop), fine-tuning and any other operations that can be performed to
create the chatbot itself. Alignment, for instance, is supposed to
ensure that the answers of a chatbot, whatever their modalities, fits
with the value of a society: as one of the article we have published in
the <em>Memory Studies Review</em> special issue we coordinated with
Sarah Gensburger, in the end, “alignment” is all about pleasing the
shareholders of the society that publishes the platform, which implies
to get money from the chatbots, which probably means that the answers
must please a large number of users.</p>
<p>Of course, this alignement is obvious for chatbots that are published
in an authoritarian state. We have seen the DeepSeek Tienanmen example
before. I could also give the example of ruDALLE, a russian image
generation platform, that will send back an image of flowers to all
prompts that are about Ukraine.</p>
<p>Here is a different example: midjourney, as well as DALL.E, have
filters that allow the representation of minorities, which is obviously
of good intent. But this can lead to abberations. In this image, the
aberration is to represent Leopold III as a black king colonizing
Congo.</p>

<p><img data-src="img/zeus_vectors.png" /></p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Still taking the examples of LLMs, historical concepts are encoded as
points in a multidimensional space, made of word embedings that capture
semantic relationships. Then the relationships between historical
events, figures, and concepts are captured in the distances and
directions between these vectors. Temporal relationships are encoded –
or we can suppose so – in semantic proximity and cultural associations,
including related to memory, are embedded in language patterns. This
multidimensional space is ‘compressed’ in a latent space that captures
all those relationships and, when activated by a prompt containing a
reference to the past, will send back an answer. This latent space
reflect collective memory patterns from the training corpus.</p>

## collective memory and chatbots {background-color=#000000}

<aside class=notes>

Hence can we consider that: 

- LLMs or Diffusion models as 'repositories' of digitized collective memory
- Training data selection can be viewed as some sort of memory politics
- The "averaged" nature of AI-generated historical narratives
- Absence of contested memory in statistical consensus

From a memory studies perspective, LLMs function as repositories of digitized collective memory. The selection of training data constitutes a form of memory politics, determining which historical perspectives are included or excluded. The statistical nature of these models produces "averaged" historical narratives that often elide contestation and complexity.

See the special issue we co-edited with Sarah Gensburger, out last december. Several articles insist on the "average" nature of LLMs but also the capitalistic nature of chatbots and generative AI systems: they must give the most 'popular' or 'pleasant' version of an answer to a prompt, including the past.

<p><img src="img/hakbwachs.png" width=30% /></p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>So, chatbots (and LLMs / Diffusion models behind them) are palying
their role of encoding / decoding what is to be remembered. I hope it is
what I have just explained. One of the functions of memory media is also
to play their role as media frameworks. Their affordances, including
anthropomorphism , the ways they are structured are framing what users
can expect from those systems.</p>
<p>Beyond that, we will here try to explain in which ways they are also
memory frameworks, in the meaning Halbwachs gave to this word, and I
think this is a consequence of the fact that chatbots are memory
media.</p>
<p>What does Halbwachs mean by “memory frameworks”: basically that you
can not understand how an individual remembers if you do not consider
the social group in which they are living. It is this relationship to
the group that frame the individual memory, as the group will have its
own view on the past, view that is a consequence of the social
relationships between individuals of the group, and of the insertion of
this group in a wider society.</p>

<section id="empirical-approach" class="title-slide slide level1">
<h1>empirical approach</h1>
<aside class=notes>
<p>So my first part was an attempt – probably still too drafty – of
theoricizing what are chatbots in terms of collective or cultural
memory, what will be their effect.</p>
<p>But as a historian, I have difficulties not to link this to primary
sources and to an empirical approach.</p>
<p>What I am trying to do here is to look at prompts and how users are –
this is the core of my argument – negotiating with the chatbot to get
the view of the past they wish. That implies that users may have
different prompting strategies, that their prompts evolve while
discussing – I call this discussion part ‘stochastic maieutics’ – with
the chatbot. I will try to use at the same time close and distant
reading of prompts.</p>
<p>I am using here only texts – whereas today, images can be some sort
of prompts too.</p>
<p>I am using prompts that are published open access, usually comes from
open source communities. The result is that those prompts are mostly
coming from Stable Diffusion-based platforms, as Stable Diffusion is
open source: those prompts are designed to generate image, not text.
There is no databases of prompts, to my knowledge, designed to generate
texts. Nevertheless, HuggingFace is vast, and I may have missed
something.</p>
<aside>
</section>
<section id="what-is-a-reference-to-the-past" class="slide level2">
<h2>what is a reference to the past?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>army of the european union invades budapest 2 0 2 2, highly detailed

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>army of the european union fighting on the streets of budapest 2 0 2

<aside class="notes">
<p>So the aim is to build a corpus of prompts and to analyse it. There
is a set of methodological issues to take into account: - unless I want
to study a specific event or individual, a keyword approach is
meaningless. - how to define a historical reference? All the more when
they are implicit? - how do I look for traces of temporalities in
prompts, in language?</p>
<p>Let’s take an example: the three prompts here are not refering
explicitly to the past. But just use the prompt for a search on an image
search engine: all the results are historical. We have here an implicit
reference, probably to the hungarian revolution of 1956, that was put to
an end by a soviet intervention.</p>
<p>So how to build a robust identification strategy?</p>
<p>I have tried several strategies: word embeddings, good old iramuteq
(topic modeling like approach), but also the use of LLMs: a local one
(but too ressource intensive for my computer), and of course APIs from
Claude and OpenAI. Though not perfect – the implicit part is not fully
taken into account – it’s the use of Claude that worked the best. I must
precise that for now I did not do any benchmarking, which is an obvious
weakness, that will be solved later.</p>

<p>AI systems represent a new space for the negotiation of historical
